      <p><em>Coach and Mentor, specializing in career and finances</em>  </p>
      <p>I help individuals and small businesses to fine-tune their services to fit the market and maximize their profits.
        I do this by helping them to analyze the gap between where they are now and where they are aiming to be, bringing clarity and focus to their ambitions.
        I employ structured goal-setting and monitor progress along the way, in order to achieve the desired results.
        I have helped individuals with their mindsets, getting them to the right place to design bespoke plans to improve their personal finances,
        and, if desired, helping them to earn subsidiary income alongside - or replacing - their existing job.
        I have used mindfulness-based techniques to help people to center themselves in an increasingly attention-draining and stressful world,
        and to improve their work/life balance.
        I believe that your work should be fulfilling, and that you can design ways of increasing cashflow doing what you are truly passionate about.
        I currently live a semi-nomadic lifestyle, working remotely from different parts of the world while studying web development and Java
        (I'm a big believer in life-long learning - especially in subjects that you love!)
